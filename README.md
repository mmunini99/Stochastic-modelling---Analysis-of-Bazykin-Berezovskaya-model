Here there is the code used to replicate some of the results found on Noise-induced extinction in Bazykin-Berezovskaya population model paper (Bashkirtseva, I., Ryashko, L. Noise-induced extinction in Bazykin-Berezovskaya population model. Eur. Phys. J. B 89, 165 (2016). https://doi.org/10.1140/epjb/e2016-70345-6).

Also, some new features have been investigated and new will follow. The code for computing SDE simulations is Julia, while Python has been used for Forecasting comparison. Dataset used is Data_wolves_moose_Isle_Royale_June2019.csv


For a complete math analysis that guided the development of the code look at the "Stochastic Modelling and Simulation Analysis of Noise-induced extinction in Bazykin-Berezovskaya model.pdf" file.
